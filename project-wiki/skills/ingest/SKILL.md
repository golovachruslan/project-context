# Ingest into project-wiki

Provide raw information; it ends up archived and compiled into the right project's wiki. Source-agnostic: Slack, email, PDF, doc, note, or plain paste.

**Clarify before acting:** if routing is ambiguous, the source is unclear, or a candidate could go multiple ways, use `AskUserQuestion`. Never fabricate content not supported by the source.

## Arguments

- `[content | path]` — pasted text, or a path to a file (`.md/.txt/.eml/.pdf/.docx/.html/image`).
- `--source slack|email|pdf|doc|note|paste` — auto-detected from extension / shape; defaults to `paste`.
- `--project <slug>` — skip routing and ingest directly into this project.
- `--vault <path>` — see Step 0.

## Step 0 — Resolve vault + extract content

Resolve the vault path (`--vault` → `PROJECT_WIKI_VAULT` → `.project-wiki` marker → ask). If the input is a **file**, use the `Read` tool to extract its text first (Read handles PDFs and images); for `.eml`, treat headers as `origin`/`date` metadata and the body as content. From here everything is text.

## Step 1 — Route to a project

If `--project` was given, skip to Step 2. Otherwise launch the **`router`** agent with the content (or a representative excerpt) and the vault path. It returns ranked candidates + a `suggested_slug`.

- High-confidence single match → use it (tell the user which project and why).
- Tie, low confidence, or `__new__` → `AskUserQuestion`: offer the top candidates plus "Create new project". If the user picks new, run the `init --project` flow first.

## Step 2 — Archive the raw source (immutable)

Write the content verbatim to `projects/<slug>/raw/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>.md` with frontmatter (`source`, `origin`, `date`, `project`) per the raw-source template. **Never edit a raw file after writing it.**

## Step 3 — Source summary page

Create `projects/<slug>/wiki/sources/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>.md`: a short summary of the source with `sources:` frontmatter citing the raw file. This is the page the index/search surfaces for "what did that thread/doc say?".

## Step 4 — Extract candidates

Launch the **`wiki-extractor`** agent with the archived raw path, the project slug, and the vault path. It reads the raw file + existing project wiki/index and returns ranked candidate pages (create/update), each with `[[wikilinks]]`, frontmatter, and a grounding `sources:` quote.

## Step 5 — Critic gate

Launch the **`wiki-critic`** agent with the candidate list, the project slug, and the vault path. It returns `{kept, rejected}` — ruthlessly filtered, with `create`→`update` downgrades and `requires_relocation` flags.

## Step 6 — Present + approve

Group kept candidates by target page. For each show: action (create/update), the proposed content, its source quote, and a one-line rationale. Include a compact summary of what the critic rejected (so the filter is visible). Ask via `AskUserQuestion`: approve all / approve some / reject all.

## Step 7 — Apply (surgical, drift-safe)

For each approved candidate:
- **create** → `Write` a new page under the correct typed folder with full frontmatter (including `sources:` and `updated: <today>`).
- **update** → **re-read the target page AND its cited raw source**, then `Edit` the specific section. Do not rewrite the whole page.
- **person** (`type: person`) → write/update `people/+<slug>.md` at the **vault level** (not under a project) from the `_templates/person.md` template; fill only the contact fields the source provided. Add or refresh the person's `- [[+<slug>]] — <role>, <team>` line in `people/index.md`. In wiki pages that mention the person, link them with `[[+<slug>]]`.
- Add/refresh the page's one-line entry in the project `index.md` (or the matching `indexes/<type>.md` if sharded).
- If a new project page was created, add it to the global `index.md`.
- If a candidate carried `cross_project`, add the `[[projects/<other>/_project]]` link to both `_project.md` files' `## Dependencies` sections and note that `dependencies.md` should be regenerated (lint `--fix`).

## Step 8 — Enforce budgets on touched files

For each `_project.md` / `progress.md` / wiki page you touched, check line count (`wc -l` or the `wiki_lint.py` output). If over budget, relocate per the schema:
- wiki page > 800 lines → split a section into `<type>/<topic>/refs/*.md`, leave a `[[link]]`.
- `_project.md` > 60 → move prose detail to a wiki page, leave a `[[link]]`.
- `progress.md` > 80 → move older completed items to `progress/archive.md`, leave a one-line summary.
The touched file must end under its cap. Nothing is deleted — `raw/` retains everything.

## Step 9 — Log + commit

Append one line to `log.md`: `<date> | ingest | <project> | <source> | pages: [[...]]`. Then suggest a vault commit (do not commit without the user asking).

## Edge cases

- **Spans two projects** — archive raw to the primary; create/update pages in both if the critic kept cross-project candidates; record the dependency link.
- **Nothing worth compiling** (critic kept zero) — still keep the archived raw + source summary page; say "no durable pages this time." That's valid.
- **Agent tool unavailable** — fall back to doing extraction + filtering inline in the main session, but keep the two-pass discipline (gather broadly, then cut hard) and the mandatory source quotes.
- **Duplicate source** — if a near-identical raw file already exists, ask before re-ingesting.
